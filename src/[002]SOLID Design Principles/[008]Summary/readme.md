# Solid Design Principles

* Single Responsibility Principle.
  * A class should only have one reason to change.
  * Separation of concerns - different classes handling different, independent tasks/problems.
* Open-Close Principle.
  * Classes should be open to extension but closed to modification.
* Liskov Substitution Principle.
  * You should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype.
* Interface Segmentation Principle.
  * Don't put too much into an interface; split into seperate interfaces.
  * YAGNI - "You ain't going to need it" 
* Dependency Inversion Principle.
  * High-level modules should not depend upon low-level ones; use abstractions.
