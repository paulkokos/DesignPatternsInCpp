# Fluent Builder
So one of the improvements that I want to add to our implementation of the builder is something called

a fluent interface so as you can see we've got two child coal's here one after another.

And what if I told you that you can actually do them like this sort of ADD child 1 and then add child

to another.

This is actually quite common in design patterns such as the builder and it's called a fluent interface.
