# Builder
So in the previous example we actually looked at how you can build simple bits of HDMI out of strings.

But obviously this approach doesn't really scale if you want to build something large.

So in this case what you would typically do is you would start creating object oriented structures which

actually represent the different parts of the DMO that you're building.
