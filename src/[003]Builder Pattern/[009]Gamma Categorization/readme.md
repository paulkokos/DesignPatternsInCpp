#### Design patterns
* Design patterns are typically split into three categories.
* This is Gamma categorization after Erich Gamma, one of GoF authors.

#### Creational patterns </br>
* Deal with the creation (construction) of objects
* Explicit (constructor) VS implisit (DI,reflection)
* Wholesale (single statement) VS piecewise (step-by-step)
#### Structural Patterns
* Concerned with the structure (e.g. class members)
* Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class interface
* Stress the importance of good API design
#### Behavioral Patterns
* They are all difference; No central theme
