#### Design patterns
* Design patterns are typically split into three categories.
* This is Gamma categorization after Erich Gamma, one of GoF authors.

#### Creational patterns </br>
* Deal with the creation (construction) of objects.
* Explicit (constructor) VS implicit (DI,reflection).
* Wholesale (single statement) VS piecewise (step-by-step).
#### Structural Patterns
* Concerned with the structure (e.g. class members).
* Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class interface.
* Stress the importance of good API design.
#### Behavioral Patterns
* They are all difference; No central theme.
